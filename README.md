Simple CNN for binary classification of casting product defects
The quality of casting is crucial in ensuring the safety and reliability of engineering structures.

Casting defects can occur during the manufacturing process, leading to compromised performance, reduced durability, and potentially catastrophic failures. Automated defect detection using computer vision techniques is a promising solution to address this issue.

In this project, I propose a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) model for binary classification of casting defects. This model is designed to classify castings as either defective or non-defective based on images captured during the production process and it achieved 97.5% acuuracy and 97.4% F-1 score.

For this work I used a "casting product image data for quality inspection" dataset which contains 6633 already augmented images of front view of a casting product in the train set, and 715 respective images in the test set.
